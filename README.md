# Every-password-in-my-school-district
I made this script to prove how insecure my school's password policy is. when you run this file it generates a list of all passwords. every student in my school district has the same password format.
these passwords can be used to brute force any account. usernames can be found from the district's email or google classroom.

If a blackhat wanted to use this they would need to know the district and a username.
